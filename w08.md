# Top 10 List of Week 08

## 1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling#)  
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability 
of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

## 2. Types of CPU Scheduling  
CPU scheduling decisions may take place under the following four circumstances:
- When a process switches from the running state to the waiting state(for I/O request or invocation of wait for the termination of one of the child processes).
- When a process switches from the running state to the ready state (for example, when an interrupt occurs).
- When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state(for example, completion of I/O).
- When a process terminates.

## 3. Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive  

| Parameter       | Preemptive                                                                                                | Non-Preemptive                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic           | In this resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated to a process for a limited time.                               | Once resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated to a process, the process holds it till it completes its burst time or switches to waiting state. |
| Interrupt       | Process can be interrupted in between.                                                                    | Process can not be interrupted until it terminates itself or its time is up.                                                              |
| Starvation      | If a process having high priority frequently arrives in the ready queue, low priority process may starve. | If a process with long burst time is running CPU, then later coming process with less CPU burst time may starve.                          |
| Overhead        | It has overheads of scheduling the processes.                                                             | No overheads                                                                                                                              |
| Flexibility     | Flexible                                                                                                  | Rigid                                                                                                                                     |
| Cost            | Cost associated                                                                                           | No cost associated                                                                                                                        |
| CPU Utilization | High                                                                                                      | Low                                                                                                                                       |

## 4. [Dispatcher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)  
The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the scheduler. This function involves:
- Switching context.
- Switching to user mode.
- Jumping to the proper location in the newly loaded program.

## 5. Scheduling Criteria  
There are several different criteria to consider when trying to select the "best" scheduling algorithm for a particular situation and environment, including:
- CPU utilization : Ideally the CPU would be busy 100% of the time, so as to waste 0 CPU cycles. On a real system CPU usage should range from 40% ( lightly loaded ) to 90% ( heavily loaded. )
- Throughput : Number of processes completed per unit time. May range from 10 / second to 1 / hour depending on the specific processes.
- Turnaround time : Time required for a particular process to complete, from submission time to completion. ( Wall clock time. )
- Waiting time : How much time processes spend in the ready queue waiting their turn to get on the CPU.
- Response time : The time taken in an interactive program from the issuance of a command to the commence of a response to that command.

## 6. Scheduling Algorithms  
- [First-Come First-Serve Scheduling (FCFS)](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/first-come-first-serve) : The process which requests the CPU first, gets the CPU allocated first. It's easy to understand implement programmatically.
- [Shortest-Job First Scheduling (SJF)](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/shortest-job-first) :  Works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first. This is the best approach to minimize waiting time.
- [Priority Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/priority-scheduling) : The priority of a process is generally the inverse of the CPU burst time
- [Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/round-robin-scheduling) : A fixed time is allotted to each process, called quantum, for execution.
- [Multilevel Queue Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multilevel-queue-scheduling) : Another class of scheduling algorithms has been created for situations in which processes are easily classified into different groups.
- [Multilevel Feedback-Queue Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multilevel-feedback-queue-scheduling) : processes are permanently assigned to a queue on entry to the system.

## 7. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/essential/threads/priority.html)  
Execution of multiple threads on a single CPU in some order is called scheduling. The Java runtime environment supports a very simple, deterministic scheduling algorithm called fixed-priority scheduling. This algorithm schedules threads on the 
basis of their priority relative to other Runnable threads.

## 8. [Multiple-processor Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor_scheduling)  
In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPUâ€™s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible. Load sharing revolves around balancing the load between multiple processors.Multi-processor systems may be heterogeneous, ( different kinds of CPUs ), 
or homogenous, ( all the same kind of CPU ).
- Approaches to Multiple-Processor Scheduling : Asymmetric multiprocessing (one processor is the master, the other one just runs the code) and Symmetric multiprocessing (where each processor schedules its own jobs)
- Processor Affinity : Soft affinity (system attempts to keep processes on the same processor but makes no guarantees) and Hard affinity (a process specifies that it is not to be moved between processors)
- Load Balancing : Push migration ( a separate process that runs periodically, and moves processes from heavily loaded processors onto less loaded ones) and Pull migration (idle processors taking processes from the ready queues of other processors)
- Multicore Processors : Coarse-grained (switches between threads only when one thread blocks, say on a memory read) and Fine-grained ( occurs on smaller regular intervals, say on the boundary of instruction cycles)

## 9. [Real-Time CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)  
Real-time systems are those in which the time at which tasks complete is crucial to their performance
- Soft real-time systems have degraded performance if their timing needs cannot be met. Example: streaming video.
- Hard real-time systems have total failure if their timing needs cannot be met. Examples: Assembly line robotics, automobile air-bag deployment.
 
## 10. Windows XP Scheduling   
- Windows XP uses a priority-based preemptive scheduling algorithm.
- The dispatcher uses a 32-level priority scheme to determine the order of thread execution, divided into two classes - variable class from 1 to 15 and real-time class from 16 to 31, ( plus a thread at priority 0 managing memory. )
- There is also a special idle thread that is scheduled when no other threads are ready.
- Win XP identifies 7 priority classes ( rows on the table below ), and 6 relative priorities within each class ( columns. )
- Processes are also each given a base priority within their priority class. When variable class processes consume their entire time quanta, then their priority gets lowered, but not below their base priority.
- Processes in the foreground ( active window ) have their scheduling quanta multiplied by 3, to give better response to interactive processes in the foreground.
