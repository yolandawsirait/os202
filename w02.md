# Top 10 List of Week 02 

1. Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved.It in
volves guarding computer resources against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or disruption.Meanwhile, protection is a set of mechanisms that control the access of processes and users to the resources defined
by a computer system. 

2. CIA triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization:
- Confidentiality : Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data
- Integrity: Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously
- Availability: Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so

3. Types of program threats:
- Malware : Malware is software designed to exploit,disable or damage computer system.(Trojan horse, trojan mules, spyware,ransomware)
- Code injection : Adding or modifying executable code
- Virus : A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program. Viruses are self-replicating and are designed to infect other programs.
It works by modifying or destroying files and causing system crashes and program malfunctions.

4. Types of system and network threats:
- Attacking Network traffic 
An attacker can be passive (sniffing) or active (masquerading/spoofing or man in the middle)
- Denial of Service
The service is put out of action as the packets sent over the network to overload the server’s capabilities and make the server unavailable to other 
devices and users throughout the network. DoS attacks are used to shut down individual machines and networks so that they can’t be used by other users.
- Port Scanning 
Hacker will detect a system's vulnerabilities to attack

5. Cryptography is the system by which data and information are stored or transmitted in a manner that allows only those for whom it is intended to read, 
interpret or process it using a system of encryption. Cryptography is used to secure data in transmission, data in storage, and user authentication.
There are three types of cryptography: secret-key, public key and hash function.

6. 3 common ways to guess a password:
- Human or program know the user or to have informations about the user
- Brute force by trying all possible combinations of valid password characters until the password is found
- Dictionary attacks where all words, word variations and common passwords are tried

7. What is passphrase? A passphrase is similar to a password. However, a password generally refers to something used to authenticate or log into a system. 
A password generally refers to a secret used to protect an encryption key. Commonly, an actual encryption key is derived from the passphrase and used to encrypt 
the protected resource.The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key. This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker.

8. An access right is permission to perform an operation on an object. A domain is a set of rights. Processes execute in domains and may use any of the access
rights in the domain to access and manipulate objects. During its lifetime, a process may be either bound to a protection domain or allowed to switch from one domain to another.

9. Four-layered model of security:
- Application
attacks : logic bugs, design flaws, code injections
prevention: sandboxing, software restrictions
- OS 
attacks : insecure defaults, platform vulnerabilities
prevention: patches, configuration, hardening
- Network
attacks :  sniffing, spoofing, masquerading
prevention : encryption, authentication, filtering
- Physical
attacks:console access, hardware-based attacks
prevention: guards, vaults, device data encryption

10. There are many security solutions, it ranges from improving user eduction through technology, to writing better software. These are couple ways to implement security defenses: 
Security solutions security policy, vulnerability assessment (social engineering through risk assessment to port scans),intrusion prevention, virus protection, sandboxing, auditing, accounting and logging
(review the logs periodically, or automate alerts) and firewall.
